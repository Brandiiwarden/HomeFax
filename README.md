# HomeFax compiles information and the history of properties that are currently on the market and presents them to the public. If a property is not on the market, it can be viewed by the home owners/primary residents. HomeFax aims to provide you with the information you need while considering a home to rent/buy. As a buyer or renter, our extensive review process allows for you to receive the most updated information about the property. As the property owner or manager, we compile all of the information about your home in one place, such as paint colors, appliances and date of past repairs. This is so that you can stay informed about your home if you need to repair, renovate or update anything.
